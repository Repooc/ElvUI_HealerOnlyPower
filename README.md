# Healer Only Power for ElvUI (ElvUI Plugin)


**Do you wish you could hide your power bars for all the roles besides your healers in ElvUI's unitframes??**  

### With this plugin, you are now able to do so. Currently only supports this on the party, raid 1-3 unitframes... Any other additional options will come later assuming I can think of something good enough to add.
