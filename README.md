Have you ever wanted to streamline your ElvUI unitframes by hiding power bars for non-healer roles?

**Healer Only Power** is the solution! This ElvUI plugin allows you to focus on what matters by displaying power bars exclusively for the healers in your party and raid 1-3 unitframes.

### Features:
- **Simplified Interface:** Enhance your healing experience by decluttering unitframes.
- **Role-Specific Visibility:** Power bars appear only for characters in ***healer roles*\***.
- **Tank Specific Override:** When the healer only option is enabled, you can also override the feature to monitor a couple specific tank's power.

**\*** *This was and has been the idea of the plugin with the one expection for those healers that like to monitor a couple specific classes.*

### Future Updates:
Anticipate an evolving experience! I strive to keep Healer Only Power up to everyone's needs. While I welcome and value your feedback, please understand that not all suggestions may be implemented. I'll carefully consider each idea for additional customization options and features, ensuring that any future updates align with the essence of this plugin or at the very minimum, not break anything lol.

Your input is crucial in shaping the journey of this addon. Thank you for being part of the community driving its growth!

*Note: Ensure you have ElvUI installed for optimal functionality.*
